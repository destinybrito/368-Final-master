  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I was born in Yakima Washington and relocated to Seattle when I was 5 due to my dad's job in the Washington State Patrol. When I moved to Seattle my mom enrolled me in piano lessons and I started when I was only 5. I attended school in Seattle and picked up on the violin when I was about 12. When I was 14 we moved from Seattle to the Tri-Cities when my dad's job changed once again. I still played piano and violin and switched music teachers until I was 18. </p>
  <p> When I was 5 I started gymnastics at a facility in Seattle and continued to a different gym when we moved. I did competitive gymnastics until I was 18. When I was 12 I started competitive cheer in Tri-Cities and continued to do it into college. I was an Eastern Cheerleader for two years and was scouted for different schools but decided that EWU was going to be the school for me. </p>

  <p> Starting my second year on Eastern cheer, during a football game while tumbling out of the tunnel I tore my ACL. I still wanted to do sports but I knew the healing process for an ACL tear would be about a year. I got surgery the same year I tore it and decided against getting back into cheer and gymnastics.</p>

 <h2>Work</h2>
  <p>Since tearing my ACL, I decided it was time to pass on my knowledge and to find a job that would suit me. I have been coaching at Build-It Athletix for almost two years and it's made me realize how much I like coaching. The ages we coach are from 3-18 and requires a lot of patience and creativity when dealing with such a large age gap. I enjoy coaching and I see the ending of my cheer career as a blessing in disguise so I can help other kids be great gymanstics and cheerleaders.  </p>
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I have always enjoyed being outdoors and learning new activities. I enjoy hiking, rafting, rock climbing, and anything that has to do with bikes. During the winter I like to go snowboarding and skiing along with snow mobiling. My family travels to Colorado regularly during the winter to be with relatives and to go on ski trips. I was fortunate enough to be with such an active family who has a broad range of activities. </p>
 <p>I really enjoy music and I have been playing piano for 17 years, violin for 10, and just recently learned guitar a couple years ago. I have taken an interest in not only learning how to play instruments, but also on reading books on different music icons. A couple of very big inspirations for how passionate I am about music are Kurt Cobain and Patti Smith. I have read almost every book on them and they are what drive me to stay involved in the music industry. I like listening, making, and producing music with people and it has turned out to be a big part in my life and where I want to go in my profession. </p>
